# LaTeX-Temps
This repo contains some basic LaTeX templates, feel free to suggest any changes.
Some templates contain Images or Logos, for such files, also download the Image and put it in the same location as your TeX file.
If your file is located in a seperate folder, you can simply put the path of your Image into the \includegraphics[]{} command
For Images located in a sub-directory of your TeX file, use this :  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./folder_name/image_name.png}
For Images that are located in a completely different directory, you can define an absolute path like this : \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{C:/Users/YourUsername/path/to/image/image_name.png}. 
If you dont know the exact path to your Image file, right click your file, click properties, the path is mentioned on the Location section, copy this and past into the \includegraphics command.
